  abstract = {Although large amounts of genomic data are available, it remains a challenge to reliably infer causal (i. e., regulatory) relationships among molecular phenotypes (such as gene expression), especially when multiple phenotypes are involved. We extend the interpretation of the Principle of Mendelian randomization (PMR) and present MRPC, a novel machine learning algorithm that incorporates the PMR in the PC algorithm, a classical algorithm for learning causal graphs in computer science. MRPC learns a causal biological network efficiently and robustly from integrating individual-level genotype and molecular phenotype data, in which directed edges indicate causal directions. We demonstrate through simulation that MRPC outperforms several popular general-purpose network inference methods and PMR-based methods. We apply MRPC to distinguish direct and indirect targets among multiple genes associated with expression quantitative trait loci. Our method is implemented in the R package MRPC, available on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MRPC/index.html).},

	abstract = {The principle of insufficient reason (PIR) assigns equal probabilities to each alternative of a random experiment whenever there is no reason to prefer one over the other. The maximum entropy principle (MaxEnt) generalizes PIR to the case where statistical information like expectations are given. It is known that both principles result in paradoxical probability updates for joint distributions of cause and effect. This is because constraints on the conditional P ( effect ∣ cause ) P{\textbackslash}left(\{{\textbackslash}rm\{effect\}\}{\textbar} \{{\textbackslash}rm\{cause\}\}) result in changes of P ( cause ) P{\textbackslash}left(\{{\textbackslash}rm\{cause\}\}) that assign higher probability to those values of the cause that offer more options for the effect, suggesting “intentional behavior.” Earlier work therefore suggested sequentially maximizing (conditional) entropy according to the causal order, but without further justification apart from plausibility on toy examples. We justify causal modifications of PIR and MaxEnt by separating constraints into restrictions for the cause and restrictions for the mechanism that generates the effect from the cause. We further sketch why causal PIR also entails “Information Geometric Causal Inference.” We briefly discuss problems of generalizing the causal version of MaxEnt to arbitrary causal DAGs.},

	abstract = {The discovery of causal relationships from purely observational data is a fundamental problem in science. The most elementary form of such a causal discovery problem is to decide whether X causes Y or, alternatively, Y causes X, given joint observations of two variables X,Y. An example is to decide whether altitude causes temperature, or vice versa, given only joint measurements of both variables. Even under the simplifying assumptions of no confounding, no feedback loops, and no selection bias, such bivariate causal discovery problems are challenging. Nevertheless, several approaches for addressing those problems have been proposed in recent years. We review two families of such methods: methods based on Additive Noise Models (ANMs) and Information Geometric Causal Inference (IGCI). We present the benchmark CauseEffectPairs that consists of data for 100 different cause-effect pairs selected from 37 data sets from various domains (e.g., meteorology, biology, medicine, engineering, economy, etc.) and motivate our decisions regarding the “ground truth” causal directions of all pairs. We evaluate the performance of several bivariate causal discovery methods on these real-world benchmark data and in addition on artificially simulated data. Our empirical results on real-world data indicate that certain methods are indeed able to distinguish cause from effect using only purely observational data, although more benchmark data would be needed to obtain statistically significant conclusions. One of the best performing methods overall is the method based on Additive Noise Models that has originally been proposed by Hoyer et al. (2009), which obtains an accuracy of 63 ± 10 \% and an AUC of 0.74 ± 0.05 on the real-world benchmark. As the main theoretical contribution of this work we prove the consistency of that method.},

	abstract = {The focus of the dissertation is on learning causal diagrams beyond Markov equivalence. The baseline assumptions in causal structure learning are the acyclicity of the underlying structure and causal sufficiency, which requires that there are no unobserved confounder variables in the system. Under these assumptions, conditional independence relationships contain all the information in the distribution that can be used for structure learning. Therefore, the causal diagram can be identified only up to Markov equivalence, which is the set of structures reflecting the same conditional independence relationships. Hence, for many ground truth structures, the direction of a large portion of the edges will remain unidentified. Hence, in order to learn the structure beyond Markov equivalence, generating or having access to extra joint distributions from the perturbed causal system is required. There are two main scenarios for acquiring the extra joint distributions. The first and main scenario is when an experimenter is directly performing a sequence of interventions on subsets of the variables of the system to generate interventional distributions. We refer to the task of causal discovery from such interventional data as interventional causal structure learning. In this setting, the key question is determining which variables should be intervened on to gain the most information. This is the first focus of this dissertation. The second scenario for acquiring the extra joint distributions is when a subset of causal mechanisms, and consequently the joint distribution of the system, have varied or evolved due to reasons beyond the control of the experimenter. In this case, it is not even a priori known to the experimenter which causal mechanisms have varied. We refer to the task of causal discovery from such multi-domain data as multi-domain causal structure learning. In this setup the main question is how one can take the most advantage of the changes across domains for the task of causal discovery. This is the second focus of this dissertation.
Next, we consider cases under which conditional independency may not reflect all the information in the distribution that can be used to identify the underlying structure. One such case is when cycles are allowed in the underlying structure. Unfortunately, a suitable characterization for equivalence for the case of cyclic directed graphs has been unknown so far. The third focus of this dissertation is on bridging the gap between cyclic and acyclic directed graphs by introducing a general approach for equivalence characterization and structure learning. Another case in which conditional independency may not reflect all the information in the distribution is when there are extra assumptions on the generating causal modules. A seminal result in this direction is that a linear model with non-Gaussian exogenous variables is uniquely identifiable. As the forth focus of this dissertation, we consider this setup, yet go one step further and allow for violation of causal sufficiency, and investigate how this generalization affects the identifiability.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2206.02063},
	abstract = {Causal discovery and causal reasoning are classically treated as separate and consecutive tasks: one first infers the causal graph, and then uses it to estimate causal effects of interventions. However, such a two-stage approach is uneconomical, especially in terms of actively collected interventional data, since the causal query of interest may not require a fully-specified causal model. From a Bayesian perspective, it is also unnatural, since a causal query (e.g., the causal graph or some causal effect) can be viewed as a latent quantity subject to posterior inference -- other unobserved quantities that are not of direct interest (e.g., the full causal model) ought to be marginalized out in this process and contribute to our epistemic uncertainty. In this work, we propose Active Bayesian Causal Inference (ABCI), a fully-Bayesian active learning framework for integrated causal discovery and reasoning, which jointly infers a posterior over causal models and queries of interest. In our approach to ABCI, we focus on the class of causally-sufficient, nonlinear additive noise models, which we model using Gaussian processes. We sequentially design experiments that are maximally informative about our target causal query, collect the corresponding interventional data, and update our beliefs to choose the next experiment. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our approach is more data-efficient than several baselines that only focus on learning the full causal graph. This allows us to accurately learn downstream causal queries from fewer samples while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for the quantities of interest.},

In this work, we introduce an active intervention targeting (AIT) method which enables a quick identification of the underlying causal structure of the data-generating process. Our method significantly reduces the required number of interactions compared with random intervention targeting and is applicable for both discrete and continuous optimization formulations of learning the underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) from data.

This operation generalizes marginalizing and conditioning. Some of these constraints correspond to identifiable 'dormant' independence constraints, with the well known 'Verma constraint' as one example. Recently, models defined by a set of the constraints arising after fixing from a DAG with latents, were characterized via a recursive factorization and a nested Markov property. In addition, a parameterization was given in the discrete case. In this paper we use this parameterization to describe a parameter fitting algorithm, and a search and score structure learning algorithm for these nested Markov models.

We also describe how the choice of the optimal intervention(s) depends heavily on the particular experimental set-up and the assumptions that can be made.},

	abstract = {Some of the most prominent results in causal inference have been developed in the context of atomic interventions, following the semantics of the do-operator and the inferential power of the do-calculus. In practice, many real-world settings require more complex types of interventions that cannot be represented by a simple atomic intervention. In this paper, we investigate a general class of interventions that covers some non-trivial types of policies (conditional and stochastic), which goes beyond the atomic class. Our goal is to develop general understanding and formal machinery to be able to reason about the effects of those policies, similar to the robust treatment developed to handle the atomic case. Specifically, in this paper, we introduce a new set of inference rules (akin to do-calculus) that can be used to derive claims about general interventions, which we call σ-calculus. We develop a systematic and efficient procedure for finding estimands of the effect of general policies as a function of the available observational and experimental distributions. We then prove that our algorithm and σ-calculus are both sound for the tasks of identification (Pearl, 1995) and z-identification (Bareinboim and Pearl, 2012) under this class of interventions.},

In this paper, we extend the notion of Markov equivalence of DAGs to the case of interventional distributions arising from multiple intervention experiments. We show that under reasonable assumptions on the intervention experiments, interventional Markov equivalence defines a finer partitioning of DAGs than observational Markov equivalence and hence improves the identifiability of causal models. We give a graph theoretic criterion for two DAGs being Markov equivalent under interventions and show that each interventional Markov equivalence class can, analogously to the observational case, be uniquely represented by a chain graph called interventional essential graph (also known as CPDAG in the observational case). These are key insights for deriving a generalization of the Greedy Equivalence Search algorithm aimed at structure learning from interventional data. This new algorithm is evaluated in a simulation study.},

One strand of this work studies the conditions under which evidence accumulated from non-experimental (observational) studies can be used to infer a causal relationship. In this paper, I compare the typical conditions required to infer that one variable is a direct cause of another in observational and experimental studies.

We also generalize adjustment criteria and formulas from the acyclic setting to the general one (i.e. ioSCMs). Such criteria then allow to estimate (conditional) causal effects from observational data that was (partially) gathered under selection bias and cycles. This generalizes the backdoor criterion, the selection-backdoor criterion and extensions of these to arbitrary ioSCMs. Together, our results thus enable causal reasoning in the presence of cycles, latent confounders and selection bias. Finally, we extend the ID algorithm for the identification of causal effects to ioSCMs.},

The main justification for imposing this assumption is that the set of unfaithful distributions has Lebesgue measure zero, since it can be seen as a collection of hypersurfaces in a hypercube. However, due to sampling error the faithfulness condition alone is not sufficient for statistical estimation, and strong-faithfulness has been proposed and assumed to achieve uniform or high-dimensional consistency. In contrast to the plain faithfulness assumption, the set of distributions that is not strong-faithful has nonzero Lebesgue measure and in fact, can be surprisingly large as we show in this paper. We study the strong-faithfulness condition from a geometric and combinatorial point of view and give upper and lower bounds on the Lebesgue measure of strong-faithful distributions for various classes of directed acyclic graphs. Our results imply fundamental limitations for the PC-algorithm and potentially also for other algorithms based on partial correlation testing in the Gaussian case.},

This entry focuses on counterfactualmodality which concerns what is not, but could or would havebeen. What if Martin Luther King had died when he was stabbed in 1958(Byrne 2005: 1)? What if the Americashad never been colonized? What if I were to put that box over here andthis one over there? These modes of thought and speech have been thesubject of extensive study in philosophy, linguistics, psychology,artificial intelligence, history, and many other allied fields. Thesediverse investigations are united by the fact that counterfactualmodality crops up at the center of foundational questions in thesefields., In philosophy, counterfactual modality has given rise to difficultsemantic, epistemological, and metaphysical questions:, These questions have attracted significant attention in recentdecades, revealing a wealth of puzzles and insights. While otherentries address the epistemic—the epistemology of modality—and metaphysical questions—possible worlds and actualism—this entry focuses on the semantic question. It will aim to refine thisquestion, explain its central role in certain philosophical debates,and outline the main semantic analyses of counterfactuals.,  Section 1 begins with a working definition of counterfactual conditionals (§1.1), and then surveys how counterfactuals feature in theories of agency,mental representation, and rationality (§1.2), and how they are used in metaphysical analysis and scientificexplanation (§1.3). Section 1.4 then details several ways in which the logic andtruth-conditions of counterfactuals are puzzling. This sets the stagefor the sections 2 and 3, which survey semantic analyses of counterfactuals that attempt toexplain this puzzling behavior.,  Section 2 focuses on two related analyses that were primarily developed tostudy the logic of counterfactuals: strict conditionalanalyses and similarity analyses. These analyses were not originallyconcerned with saying what the truth-conditions of particularcounterfactuals are. Attempts to extend them to that domain, however,have attracted intense criticism. Section 3 surveys more recent analyses that offer more explicit models of whencounterfactuals are true. These analyses include premise semantics (§3.1), conditional probability analyses (§3.2) and structural equations/causal models (§3.3). They are more closely connected to work on counterfactuals inpsychology, artificial intelligence, and the philosophy ofscience., Sections 2 and 3 of this entry employ some basic tools from set theory and logicalsemantics. But these sections also provide intuitive characterizationsalongside formal definitions, so familiarity with these tools is not apre-requisite. Readers interested in more familiarity with these toolswill find basic set theory, as well as Gamut (1991) and Sider(2010) useful.},

We define and analyse several different Markov properties that relate the graphical structure of a HEDG with a probability distribution on a corresponding product space over the set of nodes, for example factorization properties, structural equations properties, ordered/local/global Markov properties, and marginal versions of these. The various Markov properties for HEDGes are in general not equivalent to each other when cycles or hyperedges are present, in contrast with the simpler case of directed acyclic graphical (DAG) models (also known as Bayesian networks). We show how the Markov properties for HEDGes - and thus the corresponding graphical Markov models - are logically related to each other.},

	abstract = {The term natural experiment is used inconsistently. In one interpretation, it refers to an experiment where a treatment is randomly assigned by someone other than the researcher. In another interpretation, it refers to a study in which there is no controlled random assignment, but treatment is assigned by some external factor in a way that loosely resembles a randomized experiment---often described as an "as if random" assignment. In yet another interpretation, it refers to any non-randomized study that compares a treatment to a control group, without any specific requirements on how the treatment is assigned. I introduce an alternative definition that seeks to clarify the integral features of natural experiments and at the same time distinguish them from randomized controlled experiments. I define a natural experiment as a research study where the treatment assignment mechanism (i) is neither designed nor implemented by the researcher, (ii) is unknown to the researcher, and (iii) is probabilistic by virtue of depending on an external factor. The main message of this definition is that the difference between a randomized controlled experiment and a natural experiment is not a matter of degree, but of essence, and thus conceptualizing a natural experiment as a research design akin to a randomized experiment is neither rigorous nor a useful guide to empirical analysis. Using my alternative definition, I discuss how a natural experiment differs from a traditional observational study, and offer practical recommendations for researchers who wish to use natural experiments to study causal effects.},

However, in general the true structure is unknown and may not be a DAG structure. We therefore consider evaluating causal learning methods in terms of predicting the effects of interventions on unseen test data. Given this task, we show that there exist a variety of approaches to modeling causality, generalizing DAG-based methods. Our experiments on synthetic and biological data indicate that some non-DAG models perform as well or better than DAG-based methods at causal prediction tasks.},

	abstract = {This thesis is about machine learning and statistical approaches
    to decision making. How can we learn from data to anticipate the
    consequence of, and optimally select, interventions or actions?
    Problems such as deciding which medication to prescribe to
    patients, who should be released on bail, and how much to charge
    for insurance are ubiquitous, and have far reaching impacts on
    our lives. There are two fundamental approaches to learning how
    to act: reinforcement learning, in which an agent directly
    intervenes in a system and learns from the outcome, and
    observational causal inference, whereby we seek to infer the
    outcome of an intervention from observing the system. 
    
    The goal of this thesis to connect and unify these key
    approaches. I introduce causal bandit problems: a synthesis that
    combines causal graphical models, which were developed for
    observational causal inference, with multi-armed bandit problems,
    which are a subset of reinforcement learning problems that are
    simple enough to admit formal analysis. I show that knowledge of
    the causal structure allows us to transfer information learned
    about the outcome of one action to predict the outcome of an
    alternate action, yielding a novel form of structure between
    bandit arms that cannot be exploited by existing algorithms. I
    propose an algorithm for causal bandit problems and prove bounds
    on the simple regret demonstrating it is close to mini-max
    optimal and better than algorithms that do not use the additional
    causal information.},

Contrary to the assumptions of RD, however, we show that bare winners and bare losers in U.S. House elections (1942–2008) differ markedly on pretreatment covariates. Bare winners possess large ex ante financial, experience, and incumbency advantages over their opponents and are usually the candidates predicted to win by Congressional Quarterly's pre-election ratings. Covariate imbalance actually worsens in the closest House elections. National partisan tides help explain these patterns. Previous works have missed this imbalance because they rely excessively on model-based extrapolation. We present evidence suggesting that sorting in close House elections is due mainly to activities on or before Election Day rather than postelection recounts or other manipulation. The sorting is so strong that it is impossible to achieve covariate balance between matched treated and control observations, making covariate adjustment a dubious enterprise. Although RD is problematic for postwar House elections, this example does highlight the design's advantages over alternatives: RD's assumptions are clear and weaker than model-based alternatives, and their implications are empirically testable.},

We explicate several methodological misunderstandings widespread across disciplines by revisiting the controversy concerning the validity of RD design when applied to close elections. Although many researchers invoke the local or as-if-random assumption near the threshold, it is more stringent than the required continuity assumption. We show that this seemingly subtle point determines the appropriateness of various statistical methods and changes our understanding of how sorting invalidates the design. When multiple-testing problems are also addressed, we find that evidence for sorting in US House elections is substantially weaker and highly dependent on estimation methods. Finally, we caution that despite the temptation to improve the external validity, the extrapolation of RD estimates away from the threshold sacrifices the design's advantage in internal validity.},

	abstract = {This paper establishes the relatively weak conditions under which causal inferences from a regression–discontinuity (RD) analysis can be as credible as those from a randomized experiment, and hence under which the validity of the RD design can be tested by examining whether or not there is a discontinuity in any pre-determined (or “baseline”) variables at the RD threshold. Specifically, consider a standard treatment evaluation problem in which treatment is assigned to an individual if and only if V{\textgreater}v0, but where v0 is a known threshold, and V is observable. V can depend on the individual's characteristics and choices, but there is also a random chance element: for each individual, there exists a well-defined probability distribution for V. The density function—allowed to differ arbitrarily across the population—is assumed to be continuous. It is formally established that treatment status here is as good as randomized in a local neighborhood of V=v0. These ideas are illustrated in an analysis of U.S. House elections, where the inherent uncertainty in the final vote count is plausible, which would imply that the party that wins is essentially randomized among elections decided by a narrow margin. The evidence is consistent with this prediction, which is then used to generate “near-experimental” causal estimates of the electoral advantage to incumbency.},

Case in point: At Bing a small headline change an employee proposed was deemed a low priority and shelved for months until one engineer decided to do a quick online controlled experiment—an A/B test—to try it out. The test showed that the change increased revenue by an astonishing 12\%. It ended up being the best revenue-generating idea Bing ever had, worth \$100 million. That experience illustrates why it’s critical to adopt an “experiment with everything” approach, say Kohavi, the head of the Analysis \& Experimentation team at Microsoft, and Thomke, an HBS professor. In this article they describe how to properly design and execute A/B and other controlled tests, ensure their integrity, interpret results, and avoid pitfalls. They argue that if a company sets up the right infrastructure and software, it will be able to evaluate ideas not only for improving websites but also for new business models, products, strategies, and marketing campaigns—all relatively inexpensively. This will help it find the right path forward, especially when answers aren’t obvious or people have conflicting opinions.},

Existing approaches rely on various local heuristics for enforcing the acyclicity constraint. In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally different strategy: we formulate the structure learning problem as a purely continuous optimization problem over real matrices that avoids this combinatorial constraint entirely. 
This is achieved by a novel characterization of acyclicity that is not only smooth but also exact. The resulting problem can be efficiently solved by standard numerical algorithms, which also makes implementation effortless. The proposed method outperforms existing ones, without imposing any structural assumptions on the graph such as bounded treewidth or in-degree.},

	abstract = {Causal structure learning has been a challenging task in the past decades and several mainstream approaches such as constraint- and score-based methods have been studied with theoretical guarantees. Recently, a new approach has transformed the combinatorial structure learning problem into a continuous one and then solved it using gradient-based optimization methods. Following the recent state-of-the-arts, we propose a new gradient-based method to learn causal structures from observational data. The proposed method generalizes the recent gradient-based methods to a graph autoencoder framework that allows nonlinear structural equation models and is easily applicable to vector-valued variables. We demonstrate that on synthetic datasets, our proposed method outperforms other gradient-based methods significantly, especially on large causal graphs. We further investigate the scalability and efficiency of our method, and observe a near linear training time when scaling up the graph size.},

The question of whether it is possible to represent and address causal problems with probability theory, or if fundamentally new mathematics such as the do-calculus is required has been hotly debated, In this paper we demonstrate that, while it is critical to explicitly model our assumptions on the impact of intervening in a system, provided we do so, estimating causal effects can be done entirely within the standard Bayesian paradigm. The invariance assumptions underlying causal graphical models can be encoded in ordinary Probabilistic graphical models, allowing causal estimation with Bayesian statistics, equivalent to the do-calculus.},

is optimal: when the available sample size is large and robustness is an important concern. We apply our model to shed light on the practice of rerandomization, used to 
improve balance across treatment and control groups. We show that rerandomization creates a trade-off between subjective performance and robust performance 
guarantees. However, robust performance guarantees diminish very slowly with the number of rerandomizations. This suggests that moderate levels of rerandomization 
usefully expand the set of acceptable compromises between subjective performance and robustness. Targeting a fixed quantile of balance is safer than targeting an 
absolute balance objective.},

Since the latter is a standard ingredient in Bayesian inference, we argue that in Bayesian causal inference it is natural to link the causal model, including the notion of confounding and definition of causal contrasts of interest, to the concept of exchangeability. Here we propose a probabilistic between-group exchangeability property as an identifying condition for causal effects, relate it to alternative conditions for unconfounded inferences, commonly stated using potential outcomes, and define causal contrasts in the presence of exchangeability in terms of posterior predictive expectations for further exchangeable units. While our main focus is in a point treatment setting, we also investigate how this reasoning carries over to longitudinal settings.},

	abstract = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have become increasingly popular in both marketing practice and academia. However, RCTs are not always available as a solution for advertising measurement, necessitating the use of observational methods. We present the first large-scale exploration of two observational methods, double/debiased machine learning (DML) and stratified propensity score matching (SPSM). Specifically, we analyze 663 large-scale experiments at Facebook, each of which is described using over 5,000 user- and experiment-level features. Although DML performs better than SPSM, neither method performs well, despite using deep learning models to implement the propensity scores and outcome models. The median absolute percentage point difference in lift is 115\%, 107\%, and 62\% for upper, mid, and lower funnel outcomes, respectively. These are large measurement errors, given that the median RCT lifts are 28\%, 19\%, and 6\% for the funnel outcomes, respectively. We further leverage our large sample of experiments to characterize the circumstances under which each method performs comparatively better. However, broadly speaking, our results suggest that state-of-the-art observational methods are unable to recover the causal effect of online advertising at Facebook. We conclude that observational methods for estimating ad effectiveness may not work until advertising platforms log auction-specific features for modeling.},

	abstract = {Peer effects, in which an individual’s behavior is affected by peers’ behavior, are posited by multiple theories in the social sciences. Randomized field experiments that identify peer effects, however, are often expensive or infeasible, so many studies of peer effects use observational data, which is expected to suffer from confounding. Here we show, in the context of information and media diffusion, that high-dimensional adjustment of a nonexperimental control group (660 million observations) using propensity score models produces estimates of peer effects statistically indistinguishable from those using a large randomized experiment (215 million observations). Compared with the experiment, naive observational estimators overstate peer effects by over 300\% and commonly available variables (e.g., demographics) offer little bias reduction. Adjusting for a measure of prior behaviors closely related to the focal behavior reduces this bias by 91\%, while models adjusting for over 3700 past behaviors provide additional bias reduction, reducing bias by over 97\%, which is statistically indistinguishable from unbiasedness. This demonstrates how detailed records of behavior can improve studies of social influence, information diffusion, and imitation; these results are encouraging for the credibility of some studies but also cautionary for studies of peer effects in rare or new behaviors. More generally, these results show how large, high-dimensional datasets and statistical learning can be used to improve causal inference.

	abstract = {Most questions in social and biomedical sciences are causal in nature: what would happen to individuals, or to groups, if part of their environment were changed? In this groundbreaking text, two world-renowned experts present statistical methods for studying such questions. This book starts with the notion of potential outcomes, each corresponding to the outcome that would be realized if a subject were exposed to a particular treatment or regime. In this approach, causal effects are comparisons of such potential outcomes. The fundamental problem of causal inference is that we can only observe one of the potential outcomes for a particular subject. The authors discuss how randomized experiments allow us to assess causal effects and then turn to observational studies. They lay out the assumptions needed for causal inference and describe the leading analysis methods, including matching, propensity-score methods, and instrumental variables. Many detailed applications are included, with special focus on practical aspects for the empirical researcher.},

By definition, one can never observe such quantities, nor assess empirically the validity of any modeling assumptions made about them, even though one's conclusions may be sensitive to these assumptions. Here I argue that for making inference about the likely effects of applied causes, counterfactual arguments are unnecessary and potentially misleading. An alternative approach, based on Bayesian decision analysis, is presented. Properties of counterfactuals are relevant to inference about the likely causes of observed effects, but close attention then must be given to the nature and context of the query, as well as to what conclusions can and cannot be supported empirically. In particular, even in the absence of Statistical uncertainty, such inferences may be subject to an irreducible degree of ambiguity.},

mechanics which are most general The first lectures tackle head on the ideas of a
probability amplitude, the interference of amplitudes, the abstract notion of a state,

the start In each instance the ideas are introduced together with a detailed discussion
of some specific examples - to try to make the physical ideas as real as possible
The time dependence of states including states of definite energy comes next, and
the ideas are applied at once to the study of two-state systems A detailed discussion
of the ammonia maser provides the framework for the introduction to radiation absorption
and induced transitions The lectures then go on to consider more complex systems,
leading to a discussion of the propagation of electrons in a crystal, and to a rather
complete treatment of the quantum mechanics of angular momentum Our introduction to
quantum mechanics ends in Chapter 20 with a discussion of the Schroedinger wave function,
its differential equation, and the solution for the hydrogen atom The last Chapter
of this volume is not intended to be a part of the 'course' It is a 'seminar' on superconductivity
and was given in the spirit of some of the entertainment lectures of the first two
volumes, with the intent of opening to the students a broader view of the relation
of what they were learning to the general culture of physics Feynman's 'epilogue'

He calls x a random variable “since a probability can be ascribed to the event that x will take a value less than c for any given c.” If nc is the number of objects in the lot whose weight is less than c that probability is nc/n. On page 11, Wald says that “statistical problems arise when the distribution function of a random variable is not known and we want to draw some inference concerning the unknown distribution function on the basis of a limited number of observations.” He then mentions, as an example, the random variable x assuming the value 0 if a unit selected from a completely unknown lot of products is nondefective, and the value 1 if the unit is defective.},

Our second main result gives sufficient conditions for the Borel measurability of optimal transports and transportation costs with respect to a parameter in the case where marginal measures and cost functions depend on a parameter. As a corollary we obtain the Borel measurability with respect to the parameter for disintegrations of optimal plans. Finally, we show that the Skorohod parametrization of measures by mappings can be also made measurable with respect to a parameter.},

A seemingly unrelated problem in epidemiology is that of confounding: bias in estimation of the effects of an exposure on disease risk, due to inherent differences in risk between exposed and unexposed individuals. Using a simple deterministic model for exposure effects, a logical connection is drawn between the concepts of identifiability, exchangeability, and confounding. This connection allows one to view the problem of confounding as arising from problems of identifiability, and reveals the exchangeability assumptions that are implicit in confounder control methods. It also provides further justification for confounder definitions based on comparability of exposure groups, as opposed to coHapsJbility-based definitions.},

	abstract = {Directed acyclic graph (DAG) models may be characterized in at least four different ways: via a factorization, the d-separation criterion, the moralization criterion, and the local Markov property. As pointed out by Robins (1986, 1999), Verma and Pearl (1990), and Tian and Pearl (2002b), marginals of DAG models also imply equality constraints that are not conditional independences. The well-known `Verma constraint' is an example. Constraints of this type were used for testing edges (Shpitser et al., 2009), and an efficient marginalization scheme via variable elimination (Shpitser et al., 2011). We show that equality constraints like the `Verma constraint' can be viewed as conditional independences in kernel objects obtained from joint distributions via a fixing operation that generalizes conditioning and marginalization. We use these constraints to define, via Markov properties and a factorization, a graphical model associated with acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs). We show that marginal distributions of DAG models lie in this model, prove that a characterization of these constraints given in (Tian and Pearl, 2002b) gives an alternative definition of the model, and finally show that the fixing operation we used to define the model can be used to give a particularly simple characterization of identifiable causal effects in hidden variable graphical causal models.},

The vigorous exploration of this theory was begun by Professor Wald five or six years ago and is being continued under his leadership. The critical and philosophical remarks in this exposition may not accurately represent the views of Professor Wald, for both in writing and lecturing, he prefers to be rather non-committal on such points.

	abstract = {‘The Democrats will probably win the next election.’, ‘The coin is just as likely to land heads as tails.’, ‘There’s a 30\% chance of rain tomorrow.’, ‘The probability that a radium atom decays in one year isroughly 0.0004.’, One regularly reads and hears probabilistic claims like these. Butwhat do they mean? This may be understood as a metaphysical questionabout what kinds of things are probabilities, or more generally as aquestion about what makes probability statements true or false. At afirst pass, various interpretations of probability answerthis question, one way or another., However, there is also a stricter usage: an‘interpretation’ of a formal theory providesmeanings for its primitive symbols or terms, with an eye to turningits axioms and theorems into true statements about some subject. Inthe case of probability, Kolmogorov’s axiomatization (which wewill see shortly) is the usual formal theory, and the so-called‘interpretations of probability’ usually interpretit. That axiomatization introduces a function‘PPP’ that has certain formal properties. We maythen ask ‘What is PPP?’. Several of the views thatwe will discuss also answer this question, one way or another., Our topic is complicated by the fact that there are variousalternative formalizations of probability. Moreover, as we will see,some of the leading ‘interpretations of probability’ donot obey all of Kolmogorov’s axioms, yet they have notlost their title for that. And various other quantities that havenothing to do with probability do satisfy Kolmogorov’saxioms, and thus are ‘interpretations’ of it in the strictsense: normalized mass, length, area, volume, and other quantitiesthat fall under the scope of measure theory, the abstract mathematicaltheory that generalizes such quantities. Nobody seriously considersthese to be ‘interpretations of probability’, however,because they do not play the right role in our conceptualapparatus., Perhaps we would do better, then, to think of the interpretations asanalyses of various concepts of probability. Or perhapsbetter still, we might regard them as explications of suchconcepts, refining them to be fruitful for philosophical andscientific theorizing (à la Carnap 1950)., However we think of it, the project of finding such interpretations isan important one. Probability is virtually ubiquitous. It plays a rolein almost all the sciences. It underpins much of the social sciences— witness the prevalent use of statistical testing, confidenceintervals, regression methods, and so on. It finds its way, moreover,into much of philosophy. In epistemology, the philosophy of mind, andcognitive science, we see states of opinion being modeled bysubjective probability functions, and learning being modeled by theupdating of such functions. Since probability theory is central todecision theory and game theory, it has ramifications for ethics andpolitical philosophy. It figures prominently in such staples ofmetaphysics as causation and laws of nature. It appears again in thephilosophy of science in the analysis of confirmation of theories,scientific explanation, and in the philosophy of specific scientifictheories, such as quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics,evolutionary biology, and genetics. It can even take center stage inthe philosophy of logic, the philosophy of language, and thephilosophy of religion. Thus, problems in the foundations ofprobability bear at least indirectly, and sometimes directly, uponcentral scientific, social scientific, and philosophical concerns. Theinterpretation of probability is one of the most important suchfoundational problems.},

	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2020/entries/decision-theory/},
	abstract = {Decision theory is concerned with the reasoning underlying anagent’s choices, whether this is a mundane choice between takingthe bus or getting a taxi, or a more far-reaching choice about whetherto pursue a demanding political career. (Note that “agent”here stands for an entity, usually an individual person, that iscapable of deliberation and action.) Standard thinking is that what anagent chooses to do on any given occasion is completely determined byher beliefs and desires or values, but this is not uncontroversial, aswill be noted below. In any case, decision theory is as much a theoryof beliefs, desires and other relevant attitudes as it is a theory ofchoice; what matters is how these various attitudes (call them“preference attitudes”) cohere together., The focus of this entry is normative decision theory. That is, themain question of interest is what criteria an agent’s preferenceattitudes should satisfy in any genericcircumstances. This amounts to a minimal account ofrationality, one that sets aside more substantial questionsabout appropriate desires and reasonable beliefs, given the situationat hand. The key issue for a minimal account is the treatment ofuncertainty. The orthodox normative decision theory, expectedutility (EU) theory, essentially says that, in situations ofuncertainty, one should prefer the option with greatestexpected desirability or value. (Note that in this context,“desirability” and “value” should beunderstood as desirability/value according to the agent inquestion.) This simple maxim will be the focus of much of ourdiscussion., The structure of this entry is as follows: Section 1 discusses thebasic notion of “preferences over prospects”, which liesat the heart of decision theory. Section 2 describes the developmentof normative decision theory in terms of ever more powerful andflexible measures of preferences. Section 3 discusses the twobest-known versions of EU theory. Section 4 considers the broadersignificance of EU theory for practical action, inference, andvaluing. Section 5 turns to prominent challenges to EU theory, whileSection 6 addresses sequential decisions, and how this richer settingbears on debates about rational preferences.},

	doi = {10.1214/aoms/1177703871},
	abstract = {Doob (1949) obtained a very general result on the consistency of Bayes' estimates. Loosely, if any consistent estimates are available, then the Bayes' estimates are consistent for almost all values of the parameter under the prior measure. If the parameter is thought of as being selected by nature through a random mechanism whose probability law is known, Doob's result is completely satisfactory. On the other hand, in some circumstances it is necessary to identify the exceptional null set. For example, if the parameter is thought of as fixed but unknown, and the prior measure is chosen as a convenient way to calculate estimates, it is important to know for which null set the method fails. In particular, it is desirable to choose the prior so that the null set is in fact empty. The problem is very delicate; considerable work [8], [9], [12] has been done on it recently, in quite general contexts and under severe regularity assumptions. It might therefore be of interest to discuss the simplest possible case, that of independent, identically distributed, discrete observations, in some detail. This will be done in Sections 3 and 4 when the observations take a finite set of possible values. Under this assumption, Section 3 shows that the posterior probability converges to point mass at the true parameter value among almost all sample sequences (for short, the posterior is consistent; see Definition 1) exactly for parameter values in the topological carrier of the prior. In Section 4, the asymptotic normality of the posterior is shown to follow from a local smoothness assumption about the prior. In both sections, results are obtained for priors which admit the possibility of an infinite number of states. The results of these sections are not entirely new; see pp. 333 ff. of [7], pp. 224 ff. of [10], [11]. They have not appeared in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, in a form as precise as Theorems 1, 3, 4. Theorem 2 is essentially the relevant special case of Theorem 7.4 of Schwartz (1961). In Sections 5 and 6, the case of a countable number of possible values is treated. We believe the results to be new. Here the general problem appears, because priors which assign positive mass near the true parameter value may lead to ridiculous estimates. The results of Section 3 (let alone 4) are false. In fact, Theorem 5 of Section 5 gives the following construction. Suppose that under the true parameter value the observations take an infinite number of values with positive probability. Then given any spurious (sub-)stochastic probability distribution, it is possible to find a prior assigning positive mass to any neighborhood of the true parameter value, but leading to a posterior probability which converges for almost all sample sequences to point mass at the spurious distribution. Indeed, there is a prior assigning positive mass to every open set of parameters, for which the posterior is consistent only at a set of parameters of the first category. To some extent, this happens because at any stage information about a finite number of stages only is available, but on the basis of this evidence, conclusions must be drawn about all states. If the prior measure has a serious prejudice about the shape of the tails, disaster ensues. In Section 6, it is shown that a simple condition on the prior measure (which serves to limit this prejudice) ensures the consistency of the posterior. Prior probabilities leading to posterior distributions consistent at all and asymptotically normal at essentially all (see Remark 3, Section 3) parameter values are constructed. Section 5 is independent of Sections 3 and 4; Section 6 is not. Section 6 overlaps to some extent with unpublished work of Kiefer and Wolfowitz; it has been extended in certain directions by Fabius (1963). The results of this paper were announced in [5]; some related work for continuous state space is described in [3]. It is a pleasure to thank two very helpful referees: whatever expository merit Section 5 has is due to them and to L. J. Savage.},

The sample values are to be regarded as the values of a random variable defined on some meas­ urable space, and the decisions made are to be functions of this random variable. Although the roots of this notion of statistical experiment extend back nearly two hundred years, the formal treatment, which involves a description of the possible decision procedures and a conscious attempt to control errors, is of much more recent origin. Building upon the work of R. A. Fisher, J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson formalized many deci­ sion problems associated with the testing of hypotheses. Later A. Wald gave the first completely general formulation of the problem of statisti­ cal experimentation and the associated decision theory. These achieve­ ments rested upon the fortunate fact that the foundations of probability had by then been laid bare, for it appears to be necessary that any such quantitative theory of statistics be based upon probability theory. The present state of this theory has benefited greatly from contri­ butions by D. Blackwell and L. LeCam whose fundamental articles expanded the mathematical theory of statistical experiments into the field of com­ parison of experiments. This will be the main motivation for the ap­ proach to the subject taken in this book.},

	abstract = {The concept of causality has a controversial history. The question of whether it is possible to represent and address causal problems with probability theory, or if fundamentally new mathematics such as the do calculus is required has been hotly debated, e.g. Pearl (2001) states "the building blocks of our scientific and everyday knowledge are elementary facts such as "mud does not cause rain" and "symptoms do not cause disease" and those facts, strangely enough, cannot be expressed in the vocabulary of probability calculus". This has lead to a dichotomy between advocates of causal graphical modeling and the do calculus, and researchers applying Bayesian methods. In this paper we demonstrate that, while it is critical to explicitly model our assumptions on the impact of intervening in a system, provided we do so, estimating causal effects can be done entirely within the standard Bayesian paradigm. The invariance assumptions underlying causal graphical models can be encoded in ordinary Probabilistic graphical models, allowing causal estimation with Bayesian statistics, equivalent to the do calculus. Elucidating the connections between these approaches is a key step toward enabling the insights provided by each to be combined to solve real problems.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer was once a very rare disease, so rare that doctors took special notice when confronted with a case, thinking it a once-in-a-lifetime oddity. Mechanisation and mass marketing towards the end of the 19th century popularised the cigarette habit, however, causing a global lung cancer epidemic. Cigarettes were recognised as the cause of the epidemic in the 1940s and 1950s, with the confluence of studies from epidemiology, animal experiments, cellular pathology and chemical analytics. Cigarette manufacturers disputed this evidence, as part of an orchestrated conspiracy to salvage cigarette sales. Propagandising the public proved successful, judging from secret tobacco industry measurements of the impact of denialist propaganda. As late as 1960 only one-third of all US doctors believed that the case against cigarettes had been established. The cigarette is the deadliest artefact in the history of human civilisation. Cigarettes cause about 1 lung cancer death per 3 or 4 million smoked, which explains why the scale of the epidemic is so large today. Cigarettes cause about 1.5 million deaths from lung cancer per year, a number that will rise to nearly 2 million per year by the 2020s or 2030s, even if consumption rates decline in the interim. Part of the ease of cigarette manufacturing stems from the ubiquity of high-speed cigarette making machines, which crank out 20 000 cigarettes per min. Cigarette makers make about a penny in profit for every cigarette sold, which means that the value of a life to a cigarette maker is about US\$10 000.},

	abstract = {We develop a mathematical and interpretative foundation for the enterprise of decision-theoretic statistical causality (DT), which is a straightforward way of representing and addressing causal questions. DT reframes causal inference as "assisted decision-making", and aims to understand when, and how, I can make use of external data, typically observational, to help me solve a decision problem by taking advantage of assumed relationships between the data and my problem. The relationships embodied in any representation of a causal problem require deeper justification, which is necessarily context-dependent. Here we clarify the considerations needed to support applications of the DT methodology. Exchangeability considerations are used to structure the required relationships, and a distinction drawn between intention to treat and intervention to treat forms the basis for the enabling condition of "ignorability". We also show how the DT perspective unifies and sheds light on other popular formalisations of statistical causality, including potential responses and directed acyclic graphs.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06221},
	abstract = {Structural causal models (SCMs), also known as (non-parametric) structural equation models (SEMs), are widely used for causal modeling purposes. In particular, acyclic SCMs, also known as recursive SEMs, form a well-studied subclass of SCMs that generalize causal Bayesian networks to allow for latent confounders. In this paper, we investigate SCMs in a more general setting, allowing for the presence of both latent confounders and cycles. We show that in the presence of cycles, many of the convenient properties of acyclic SCMs do not hold in general: they do not always have a solution; they do not always induce unique observational, interventional and counterfactual distributions; a marginalization does not always exist, and if it exists the marginal model does not always respect the latent projection; they do not always satisfy a Markov property; and their graphs are not always consistent with their causal semantics. We prove that for SCMs in general each of these properties does hold under certain solvability conditions. Our work generalizes results for SCMs with cycles that were only known for certain special cases so far. We introduce the class of simple SCMs that extends the class of acyclic SCMs to the cyclic setting, while preserving many of the convenient properties of acyclic SCMs. With this paper we aim to provide the foundations for a general theory of statistical causal modeling with SCMs.},

We prove the closedness of \{{\textbackslash}sigma\}-separation under marginalisation and conditioning and exploit this to implement a test of \{{\textbackslash}sigma\}-separation on a \{{\textbackslash}sigma\}-CG. This then leads us to the first causal discovery algorithm that can handle non-linear functional relations, latent confounders, cyclic causal relationships, and data from different (stochastic) perfect interventions.

Proponents of "causal" decision theory have argued that Jeffrey's account is inadequate because it fails to properly discriminate the causal features of acts from their merely evidential properties. Jeffrey's approach has also been criticized on the grounds that it makes it impossible to extract a unique probability/utility representation from a sufficiently rich system of preferences (given a zero and unit for measuring utility). The existence of these problems should not blind us to the fact that Jeffrey's system has advantages that no other decision theory can match: it can be underwritten by a particularly compelling representation theorem proved by Ethan Bolker; and it has a property called partition invariance that every reasonable theory of rational choice must possess. I shall argue that the non-uniqueness problem can be finessed, and that it is impossible to adequately formulate causal decision theory, or any other, without using Jeffrey's theory as one's basic analysis of rational desire.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03543},
	abstract = {We present a computable algorithm that assigns probabilities to every logical statement in a given formal language, and refines those probabilities over time. For instance, if the language is Peano arithmetic, it assigns probabilities to all arithmetical statements, including claims about the twin prime conjecture, the outputs of long-running computations, and its own probabilities. We show that our algorithm, an instance of what we call a logical inductor, satisfies a number of intuitive desiderata, including: (1) it learns to predict patterns of truth and falsehood in logical statements, often long before having the resources to evaluate the statements, so long as the patterns can be written down in polynomial time; (2) it learns to use appropriate statistical summaries to predict sequences of statements whose truth values appear pseudorandom; and (3) it learns to have accurate beliefs about its own current beliefs, in a manner that avoids the standard paradoxes of self-reference. For example, if a given computer program only ever produces outputs in a certain range, a logical inductor learns this fact in a timely manner; and if late digits in the decimal expansion of \${\textbackslash}pi\$ are difficult to predict, then a logical inductor learns to assign \${\textbackslash}approx 10{\textbackslash}\%\$ probability to "the \$n\$th digit of \${\textbackslash}pi\$ is a 7" for large \$n\$. Logical inductors also learn to trust their future beliefs more than their current beliefs, and their beliefs are coherent in the limit (whenever \${\textbackslash}phi {\textbackslash}implies {\textbackslash}psi\$, \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}\_{\textbackslash}infty({\textbackslash}phi) {\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}\_{\textbackslash}infty({\textbackslash}psi)\$, and so on); and logical inductors strictly dominate the universal semimeasure in the limit. These properties and many others all follow from a single logical induction criterion, which is motivated by a series of stock trading analogies. Roughly speaking, each logical sentence \${\textbackslash}phi\$ is associated with a stock that is worth {\textbackslash}\$1 per share if [...]},

The theory introduced in   [Pearl   and Bareinboim, 2011] (henceforth [PB, 2011]) defines formal conditions for such transfer but falls short of providing an effective procedure for deciding, given assumptions about differences between the source and target domains, whether transportability is feasible. This paper provides such procedure. It establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for deciding when causal effects in the target domain are estimable from both the statistical information available and the causal information transferred from the experiments.

	abstract = {Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are increasingly popular in the social sciences, not only in medicine. We argue that the lay public, and sometimes researchers, put too much trust in RCTs over other methods of investigation. Contrary to frequent claims in the applied literature, randomization does not equalize everything other than the treatment in the treatment and control groups, it does not automatically deliver a precise estimate of the average treatment effect (ATE), and it does not relieve us of the need to think about (observed or unobserved) covariates. Finding out whether an estimate was generated by chance is more difficult than commonly believed. At best, an RCT yields an unbiased estimate, but this property is of limited practical value. Even then, estimates apply only to the sample selected for the trial, often no more than a convenience sample, and justification is required to extend the results to other groups, including any population to which the trial sample belongs, or to any individual, including an individual in the trial. Demanding ‘external validity’ is unhelpful because it expects too much of an RCT while undervaluing its potential contribution. RCTs do indeed require minimal assumptions and can operate with little prior knowledge. This is an advantage when persuading distrustful audiences, but it is a disadvantage for cumulative scientific progress, where prior knowledge should be built upon, not discarded. RCTs can play a role in building scientific knowledge and useful predictions but they can only do so as part of a cumulative program, combining with other methods, including conceptual and theoretical development, to discover not ‘what works’, but ‘why things work’.},

	abstract = {Summary. Many scientific problems require that treatment comparisons be adjusted for posttreatment variables, but the estimands underlying standard methods are not causal effects. To address this deficiency, we propose a general framework for comparing treatments adjusting for posttreatment variables that yields principal effects based on principal stratification. Principal stratification with respect to a posttreatment variable is a cross-classification of subjects defined by the joint potential values of that posttreatment variable under each of the treatments being compared. Principal effects are causal effects within a principal stratum. The key property of principal strata is that they are not affected by treatment assignment and therefore can be used just as any pretreatment covariate, such as age category. As a result, the central property of our principal effects is that they are always causal effects and do not suffer from the complications of standard posttreatment-adjusted estimands. We discuss briefly that such principal causal effects are the link between three recent applications with adjustment for posttreatment variables: (i) treatment noncompliance, (ii) missing outcomes (dropout) following treatment noncompliance, and (iii) censoring by death. We then attack the problem of surrogate or biomarker endpoints, where we show, using principal causal effects, that all current definitions of surrogacy, even when perfectly true, do not generally have the desired interpretation as causal effects of treatment on outcome. We go on to formulate estimands based on principal stratification and principal causal effects and show their superiority.},

	abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. Christopher M. Bishop is Deputy Director of Microsoft Research Cambridge, and holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.

	abstract = {Human beings organize their intuitive understanding of the world in terms of causes and effects. Primitive humanity posited gods and spirits as invisible causes of phenomena they did not comprehend. As our attempts to understand the world began to be formalized and codified as empirical science, the emphasis on discerning cause-effect relationships remained. Though we, the modern humanity, are armed with powerful computers, sophisticated technology, and highly developed mathematics and statistics, our fundamental questions remain the same as those of our cave dwelling ancestors – we seek to understand the causes of windfalls and misfortunes that befall us, what effects our actions have, and what would happen if the past were different from what it is. This thesis will address these ancient questions with the rigor and generality of modern mathematics. Using the framework of graphical causal models which formalizes a variety of causal queries, such as causal effects, counterfactuals and path-specific effects as certain types of probability distributions, I will develop algorithms which will evaluate these probability distributions from available information; prove that whenever these algorithms fail to evaluate a query, no other method could succeed; provide characterizations based on directed graphs for cases where these algorithms do succeed; and finally show how a class of constraints placed on the causal model by its directed graph are due to conditional independence in these probability distributions, and how these conditional independencies can be exploited for testing causal theories.},

	abstract = {We assume that we have observational data generated from an unknown underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) model. A DAG is typically not identifiable from observational data, but it is possible to consistently estimate the equivalence class of a DAG. Moreover, for any given DAG, causal effects can be estimated using intervention calculus. In this paper, we combine these two parts. For each DAG in the estimated equivalence class, we use intervention calculus to estimate the causal effects of the covariates on the response. This yields a collection of estimated causal effects for each covariate. We show that the distinct values in this set can be consistently estimated by an algorithm that uses only local information of the graph. This local approach is computationally fast and feasible in high-dimensional problems. We propose to use summary measures of the set of possible causal effects to determine variable importance. In particular, we use the minimum absolute value of this set, since that is a lower bound on the size of the causal effect. We demonstrate the merits of our methods in a simulation study and on a data set about riboflavin production.},

This derivation relied on the simultaneous measurement of multiple phosphorylated protein and phospholipid components in thousands of individual primary human immune system cells. Perturbing these cells with molecular interventions drove the ordering of connections between pathway components, wherein Bayesian network computational methods automatically elucidated most of the traditionally reported signaling relationships and predicted novel interpathway network causalities, which we verified experimentally. Reconstruction of network models from physiologically relevant primary single cells might be applied to understanding native-state tissue signaling biology, complex drug actions, and dysfunctional signaling in diseased cells.

In this paper, we explicitly define the causal question that is asked by these studies and discuss the problems associated with it. We argue that observational studies of obesity and mortality violate the condition of consistency of counterfactual (potential) outcomes, a necessary condition for meaningful causal inference, because (1) they do not explicitly specify the interventions on body mass index (BMI) that are being compared and (2) different methods to modify BMI may lead to different counterfactual mortality outcomes, even if they lead to the same BMI value in a given person. Besides precluding the estimation of unambiguous causal effects, this violation of consistency affects the ability to address two additional conditions that are also necessary for causal inference: exchangeability and positivity. We conclude that consistency violations not only preclude the estimation of well-defined causal effects but also compromise our ability to estimate ill-defined causal effects.},

Suppose that we intervene on the predictor variables or change the whole environment. The predictions from a causal model will in general work as well under interventions as for observational data. In contrast, predictions from a non-causal model can potentially be very wrong if we actively intervene on variables. Here, we propose to exploit this invariance of a prediction under a causal model for causal inference: given different experimental settings (e.g. various interventions) we collect all models that do show invariance in their predictive accuracy across settings and interventions. The causal model will be a member of this set of models with high probability. This approach yields valid confidence intervals for the causal relationships in quite general scenarios. We examine the example of structural equation models in more detail and provide sufficient assumptions under which the set of causal predictors becomes identifiable. We further investigate robustness properties of our approach under model misspecification and discuss possible extensions. The empirical properties are studied for various data sets, including large-scale gene perturbation experiments.},

Kant reported that Hume’s work woke him from his“dogmatic slumbers”  andJeremy Bentham remarked that reading Hume “caused the scales tofall” from his eyes.

Classical differentiation theorems, such as the Lebesgue and Rademacher differentiation theorems, are also covered, as are connections with probability theory. The material is intended to cover a quarter or semester\&\#39;s worth of material for a first graduate course in real analysis. There is an emphasis in the text on tying together the abstract and the concrete sides of the subject, using the latter to illustrate and motivate the former. The central role of key principles (such as Littlewood\&\#39;s three principles) as providing guiding intuition to the subject is also emphasized. There are a large number of exercises throughout that develop key aspects of the theory, and are thus an integral component of the text.

It is hoped that this will be useful not just to mathematicians, but also to physicists, computer scientists, and others who use diagrammatic reasoning. We have opted for a somewhat informal treatment of topological notions, and have omitted most proofs. Nevertheless, the exposition is sufficiently detailed to make it clear what is presently known, and to serve as a starting place for more in-depth study. Where possible, we provide pointers to more rigorous treatments in the literature. Where we include results that have only been proved in special cases, we indicate this in the form of caveats.},

Starting with a review of monoidal categories and their associated graphical languages, we then revisit probability theory from a categorical perspective and introduce Bayesian networks, an existing structure for describing causal relationships. Motivated by these, we propose a new algebraic structure, which we term a causal theory. These take the form of a symmetric monoidal category, with the objects representing variables and morphisms ways of deducing information about one variable from another. A major advantage of reasoning with these structures is that the resulting graphical representations of morphisms match well with intuitions for flows of information between these variables. These categories can then be modelled in other categories, providing concrete interpretations for the variables and morphisms. In particular, we shall see that models in the category of measurable spaces and stochastic maps provide a slight generalisation of Bayesian networks, and naturally form a category themselves. We conclude with a discussion of this category, classifying the morphisms and discussing some basic universal constructions.

This paper develops a new, categorically oriented view based on a clear distinction between syntax (string diagrams) and semantics (stochastic matrices), connected via interpretations as structure-preserving functors.A key notion in the identification of causal effects is that of an intervention, whereby a variable is forcefully set to a particular value independent of any prior dependencies. We represent the effect of such an intervention as an endofunctor which performs ‘string diagram surgery’ within the syntactic category of string diagrams. This diagram surgery in turn yields a new, interventional distribution via the interpretation functor. While in general there is no way to compute interventional distributions purely from observed data, we show that this is possible in certain special cases using a calculational tool called comb disintegration.We showcase this technique on a well-known example, predicting the causal effect of smoking on cancer in the presence of a confounding common cause. We then conclude by showing that this technique provides simple sufficient conditions for computing interventions which apply to a wide variety of situations considered in the causal inference literature.},

These ‘probabilistic’ models are called commutative effectuses, and are the focus of attention here. The paper describes the main known ‘probability’ monads: the monad of discrete probability measures, the Giry monad, the expectation monad, the probabilistic power domain monad, the Radon monad, and the Kantorovich monad. It also introduces successive properties that a monad should satisfy so that its Kleisli category is a commutative effectus. The main properties are: partial additivity, strong affineness, and commutativity. It is shown that the resulting commutative effectus provides a categorical model of probability theory, including a logic using effect modules with parallel and sequential conjunction, predicate- and state-transformers, normalisation and conditioning of states.},

	abstract = {We propose to meta-learn causal structures based on how fast a learner adapts to new distributions arising from sparse distributional changes, e.g. due to interventions, actions of agents and other sources of non-stationarities. We show that under this assumption, the correct causal structural choices lead to faster adaptation to modified distributions because the changes are concentrated in one or just a few mechanisms when the learned knowledge is modularized appropriately. This leads to sparse expected gradients and a lower effective number of degrees of freedom needing to be relearned while adapting to the change. It motivates using the speed of adaptation to a modified distribution as a meta-learning objective. We demonstrate how this can be used to determine the cause-effect relationship between two observed variables. The distributional changes do not need to correspond to standard interventions (clamping a variable), and the learner has no direct knowledge of these interventions. We show that causal structures can be parameterized via continuous variables and learned end-to-end. We then explore how these ideas could be used to also learn an encoder that would map low-level observed variables to unobserved causal variables leading to faster adaptation out-of-distribution, learning a representation space where one can satisfy the assumptions of independent mechanisms and of small and sparse changes in these mechanisms due to actions and non-stationarities.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06221},
	abstract = {Structural causal models (SCMs), also known as (non-parametric) structural equation models (SEMs), are widely used for causal modeling purposes. A large body of theoretical results is available for the special case in which cycles are absent (i.e., acyclic SCMs, also known as recursive SEMs). However, in many application domains cycles are abundantly present, for example in the form of feedback loops. In this paper, we provide a general and rigorous theory of cyclic SCMs. The paper consists of two parts: the first part gives a rigorous treatment of structural causal models, dealing with measure-theoretic and other complications that arise in the presence of cycles. In contrast with the acyclic case, in cyclic SCMs solutions may no longer exist, or if they exist, they may no longer be unique, or even measurable in general. We give several sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of (unique) measurable solutions. We show how causal reasoning proceeds in these models and how this differs from the acyclic case. Moreover, we give an overview of the Markov properties that hold for cyclic SCMs. In the second part, we address the question of how one can marginalize an SCM (possibly with cycles) to a subset of the endogenous variables. We show that under a certain condition, one can effectively remove a subset of the endogenous variables from the model, leading to a more parsimonious marginal SCM that preserves the causal and counterfactual semantics of the original SCM on the remaining variables. Moreover, we show how the marginalization relates to the latent projection and to latent confounders, i.e. latent common causes.},

Fisher made tremendous contributions to causal inference through his work on the design of randomized experiments, but the potential outcomes perspective applies to other complex experiments and nonrandomized studies as well. As noted by Kempthorne in his 1976 discussion of Savage's Fisher lecture, Fisher never bridged his work on experimental design and his work on parametric modeling, a bridge that appears nearly automatic with an appropriate view of the potential outcomes framework, where the potential outcomes and covariates are given a Bayesian distribution to complete the model specification. Also, this framework crisply separates scientific inference for causal effects and decisions based on such inference, a distinction evident in Fisher's discussion of tests of significance versus tests in an accept/reject framework. But Fisher never used the potential outcomes framework, originally proposed by Neyman in the context of randomized experiments, and as a result he provided generally flawed advice concerning the use of the analysis of covariance to adjust for posttreatment concomitants in randomized trials.},

A DAG is typically not identifiable from observational data, but it is possible to consistently estimate the equivalence class of a DAG. Moreover, for any given DAG, causal effects can be estimated using intervention calculus. In this paper, we combine these two parts. For each DAG in the estimated equivalence class, we use intervention calculus to estimate the causal effects of the covariates on the response. This yields a collection of estimated causal effects for each covariate. We show that the distinct values in this set can be consistently estimated by an algorithm that uses only local information of the graph. This local approach is computationally fast and feasible in high-dimensional problems. We propose to use summary measures of the set of possible causal effects to determine variable importance. In particular, we use the minimum absolute value of this set, since that is a lower bound on the size of the causal effect. We demonstrate the merits of our methods in a simulation study and on a data set about riboflavin production.},

When a prior probability is available on the causal mechanisms governing the domain, counterfactual probabilities can be evaluated precisely. However, when causal knowledge is specified as conditional probabilities on the observables, only bounds can computed. This paper develops techniques for evaluating these bounds, and demonstrates their use in two applications: (1) the determination of treatment efficacy from studies in which subjects may choose their own treatment, and (2) the determination of liability in product-safety litigation.},

The SID is based on a graphical criterion only and quantifies the closeness between two DAGs in terms of their corresponding causal inference statements. It is therefore well suited for evaluating graphs that are used for computing interventions. Instead of DAGs, it is also possible to compare CPDAGs, completed partially DAGs that represent Markov equivalence classes.

Unobservable factors make exposure endogenous, and advertising’s effect on outcomes tends to be small. In principle, these concerns could be addressed using randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In practice, few online ad campaigns rely on RCTs, and instead use observational methods to estimate ad effects. We assess empirically whether the variation in data typically available in the advertising industry enables observational methods to recover the causal effects of online advertising. Using data from 15 US advertising experiments at Facebook comprising 500 million user-experiment observations and 1.6 billion ad impressions, we contrast the experimental results to those obtained from multiple observational models. The observational methods often fail to produce the same effects as the randomized experiments, even after conditioning on extensive demographic and behavioral variables. In our setting, advances in causal inference methods do not allow us to isolate the exogenous variation needed to estimate the treatment effects. We also characterize the incremental explanatory power our data would require to enable observational methods to successfully measure advertising effects. Our findings suggest that commonly used observational approaches based on the data usually available in the industry often fail to accurately measure the true effect of advertising.},

	abstract = {Independence of Conditionals (IC) has recently been proposed as a basic rule for causal structure learning. If a Bayesian network represents the causal structure, its Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs) should be algorithmically independent. In this paper we compare IC with causal faithfulness (FF), stating that only those conditional independences that are implied by the causal Markov condition hold true. The latter is a basic postulate in common approaches to causal structure learning. The common spirit of FF and IC is to reject causal graphs for which the joint distribution looks ‘non-generic’. The difference lies in the notion of genericity: FF sometimes rejects models just because one of the CPDs is simple, for instance if the CPD describes a deterministic relation. IC does not behave in this undesirable way. It only rejects a model when there is a non-generic relation between different CPDs although each CPD looks generic when considered separately. Moreover, it detects relations between CPDs that cannot be captured by conditional independences. IC therefore helps in distinguishing causal graphs that induce the same conditional independences (i.e., they belong to the same Markov equivalence class). The usual justification for FF implicitly assumes a prior that is a probability density on the parameter space. IC can be justified by Solomonoff’s universal prior, assigning non-zero probability to those points in parameter space that have a finite description. In this way, it favours simple CPDs, and therefore respects Occam’s razor. Since Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable, IC is not directly applicable in practice. We argue that it is nevertheless helpful, since it has already served as inspiration and justification for novel causal inference algorithms.},

In this book Peter Spirtes, Clark Glymour, and Richard Scheines address these questions using the formalism of Bayes networks, with results that have been applied in diverse areas of research in the social, behavioral, and physical sciences. The authors show that although experimental and observational study designs may not always permit the same inferences, they are subject to uniform principles. They axiomatize the connection between causal structure and probabilistic independence, explore several varieties of causal indistinguishability, formulate a theory of manipulation, and develop asymptotically reliable procedures for searching over equivalence classes of causal models, including models of categorical data and structural equation models with and without latent variables. The authors show that the relationship between causality and probability can also help to clarify such diverse topics in statistics as the comparative power of experimentation versus observation, Simpson's paradox, errors in regression models, retrospective versus prospective sampling, and variable selection. The second edition contains a new introduction and an extensive survey of advances and applications that have appeared since the first edition was published in 1993.},

(1999)) exploit an assumption usually referred to as the causal Faithfulness or Stability condition. In this paper, we highlight two components of the condition used in constraint-based algorithms, which we call "Adjacency-Faithfulness" and "Orientation-Faithfulness". We point out that assuming Adjacency-Faithfulness is true, it is in principle possible to test the validity of Orientation-Faithfulness. Based on this observation, we explore the consequence of making only the Adjacency-Faithfulness assumption. We show that the familiar PC algorithm has to be modified to be (asymptotically) correct under the weaker, Adjacency-Faithfulness assumption. Roughly the modified algorithm, called Conservative PC (CPC), checks whether Orientation-Faithfulness holds in the orientation phase, and if not, avoids drawing certain causal conclusions the PC algorithm would draw. However, if the stronger, standard causal Faithfulness condition actually obtains, the CPC algorithm is shown to output the same pattern as the PC algorithm does in the large sample limit. We also present a simulation study showing that the CPC algorithm runs almost as fast as the PC algorithm, and outputs significantly fewer false causal arrowheads than the PC algorithm does on realistic sample sizes. We end our paper by discussing how score-based algorithms such as GES perform when the Adjacency-Faithfulness but not the standard causal Faithfulness condition holds, and how to extend our work to the FCI algorithm, which allows for the possibility of latent variables.},

As shown by Meek (1997), this result has an important consequence for Bayesian approaches to learning Bayesian networks from data: in the limit of large sample size, there exists a two-phase greedy search algorithm that---when applied to a particular sparsely-connected search space---provably identifies a perfect map of the generative distribution if that perfect map is a DAG. We provide a new implementation of the search space, using equivalence classes as states, for which all operators used in the greedy search can be scored efficiently using local functions of the nodes in the domain. Finally, using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the two-phase greedy approach leads to good solutions when learning with finite sample sizes.},

	abstract = {A fundamental question in causal inference is whether it is possible to reliably infer manipulation effects from observational data. There are a variety of senses of asymptotic reliability in the statistical literature, among which the most commonly discussed frequentist notions are pointwise consistency and uniform consistency (see, e.g. Bickel, Doksum [2001]). Uniform consistency is in general preferred to pointwise consistency because the former allows us to control the worst case error bounds with a finite sample size. In the sense of pointwise consistency, several reliable causal inference algorithms have been constructed under the Markov and Faithfulness assumptions [Pearl 2000, Spirtes et al. 2001]. In the sense of uniform consistency, however, reliable causal inference is impossible under the two assumptions when time order is unknown and/or latent confounders are present [Robins et al. 20001. In this paper we present two natural generalizations of the Faithfulness assumption in the context of structural equation models, under which we show that the typical algorithms in the literature (in some cases with modifications) are uniformly consistent even when the time order is unknown. We also discuss the situation where latent confounders may be present and the sense in which the Faithfulness assumption is a limiting case of the stronger assumptions.},

	abstract = {Because physical theories typically predict numerical values, an improvement in experimental precision reduces the tolerance range and hence increases corroborability. In most psychological research, improved power of a statistical design leads to a prior probability approaching 1/2 of finding a significant difference in the theoretically predicted direction. Hence the corroboration yielded by "success" is very weak, and becomes weaker with increased precision. "Statistical significance" plays a logical role in psychology precisely the reverse of its role in physics. This problem is worsened by certain unhealthy tendencies prevalent among psychologists, such as a premium placed on experimental "cuteness" and a free reliance upon ad hoc explanations to avoid refutation.},

	abstract = {We clarify the status of the so-called causal minimality condition in the theory of causal Bayesian networks, which has received much attention in the recent literature on the epistemology of causation. In doing so, we argue that the condition is well motivated in the interventionist (or manipulability) account of causation, assuming the causal Markov condition which is essential to the semantics of causal Bayesian networks. Our argument has two parts. First, we show that the causal minimality condition, rather than an add-on methodological assumption of simplicity, necessarily follows from the substantive interventionist theses, provided that the actual probability distribution is strictly positive. Second, we demonstrate that the causal minimality condition can fail when the actual probability distribution is not positive, as is the case in the presence of deterministic relationships. But we argue that the interventionist account still entails a pragmatic justification of the causal minimality condition. Our argument in the second part exemplifies a general perspective that we think commendable: when evaluating methods for inferring causal structures and their underlying assumptions, it is relevant to consider how the inferred causal structure will be subsequently used for counterfactual reasoning.},
