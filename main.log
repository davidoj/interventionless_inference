the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the

I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.

I'm guessing that you meant to end an alignment here.

I've put in what seems to be necessary to fix
the current column of the current alignment.
Try to go on, since this might almost work.

! Extra }, or forgotten $.

l.180 \end{align}
                 
I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.

! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text> 
                $
l.180 \end{align}
                 
I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.

The `$' that I just saw supposedly matches a previous `$$'.
So I shall assume that you typed `$$' both times.

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
